One of the basic tasks in many home automation systems is controlling
power to appliances. They could be lights, or a heater, or an exhaust
fan, or just about anything else that runs on mains power. The problem
of course is that it's dangerous to mess with mains-level power directly
and you may even be in breach of your local building code if you don't
have the necessary qualifications. This project uses a general-purpose
appliance remote control that can be obtained from a local hardware
store and easily modified to link it to an Arduino for software control
of devices around your house without having to touch any mains-level
wiring.
