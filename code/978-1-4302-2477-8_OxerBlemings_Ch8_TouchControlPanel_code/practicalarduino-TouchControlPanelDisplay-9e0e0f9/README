NOTE: This is NOT an Arduino program! It's a Processing program which
is very similar to Arduino but designed to run on the host computer.

This program displays a virtual control panel and listens on a serial
port for X/Y coordinate values being reported to it by an Arduino with
a Nintendo DS touchscreen or other resistive touchscreen connected.
When regions on the touchscreen are pressed this program alters the
display to show the status of the virtual buttons.

A slide area is also defined, allowing a level such as volume,
temperature, or light level to be set by touching a sliding scale.
