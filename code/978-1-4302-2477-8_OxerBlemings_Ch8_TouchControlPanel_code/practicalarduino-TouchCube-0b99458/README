NOTE: This is NOT an Arduino program! It's a Processing program which
is very similar to Arduino but designed to run on the host computer.

Display a 3D cube and move the camera position based on input received
from a Nintendo DS touch screen connected to an Arduino running the
TouchControlPanelMinimal sketch.
